## The pitch

Deliverly is an app to track drivers and packages as they travel accross routes between warehouses to their final destination. Operators (admins) can track the locations of all their drivers and manage both drivers and warehouses. Packages have a three word code which can be tracked by the customer in addition to a QR code used by the driver.
